### RegEx
- `/^[a-zA-Z0-9]{6,10}$/`
  - `^` asserts position at start of a line
  - `{6,10}` matches the previous token between 6 and 10 times, as many times as possible, giving back as needed (greedy)
  - `a-z` matches a single character in the range between a (index 97) and z (index 122) (case sensitive)
  - `A-Z` matches a single character in the range between A (index 65) and Z (index 90) (case sensitive)
  - `0-9` matches a single character in the range between 0 (index 48) and 9 (index 57) (case sensitive)
  - `$` asserts position at the end of a line
- `/^.{6,10}$/`
  - `^` asserts position at start of a line
  - `.` matches any character (except for line terminators)
  - `{6,10}` matches the previous token between 6 and 10 times, as many times as possible, giving back as needed (greedy)
  - `$` asserts position at the end of a line
#### Example
- const username = '12345saitibrahim16'
- let pattern = /[a-z]{6,10}/
- console.log(pattern.test(username));// true
- console.log(username.search(pattern));// 5 --> index of first match
- pattern = /^[a-z]{6,10}$/
- console.log(pattern.test(username));// false
- console.log(username.search(pattern))// -1 --> does not match
